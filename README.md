Flexible and always in focus. Adaptive to different scales and for different proposes. 

## > goal

Master a new language, in this case, [Golang](https://go.dev/).
With this tool, I will develop a cli gui based on [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s). 

There is no doubt that *k9s* is a well build application with a practical user interface: quick to install and ease to learn.
